Here's how you do it:
1. Paste the contents of any of these files, such as [Morse-On-Any-Site.js](/Morse-On-Any-Site.js) to [this site using default settings](https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/)
2. Create the bookmarklet and put it in your bookmark bar
3. Go to any website
4. Click the bookmark
5. Press `ESC` to deload the game/bookmarklet, or refresh the site to revert to the original site.

If you wish, feel free to import my [modloader](/modloader.js) for my up to date mods.
