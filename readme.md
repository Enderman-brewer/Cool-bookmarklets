##### Do you love customizing your web experience with mods or extensions, but hate the hassle of manual installation? The Mod Loader is here to streamline the process and give you full control over your custom mods – all for free!

Key Features:
 * Easy Installation: With just one click, you can load selected mods into your browser with minimal effort.
 * Clear UI: A simple, intuitive interface displays the available mods with descriptions, so you know exactly what you're installing.
 * Mod Management: Select and load only the mods you need, directly from trusted sources, without any unnecessary steps.
 * Automatic Updates: Always up to date with the latest versions of mods, thanks to seamless fetching of mod lists.
How It Works:
   * The Mod Loader fetches a list of available mods from a trusted source.
   * It displays them in a user-friendly interface, allowing you to select mods using checkboxes.
   * Once you've chosen your mods, click the “Load Selected Mods” button, and the tool will fetch and load them into your browser automatically.
   * Conflict warnings will appear next to mods that may cause issues with others.
   * Enjoy your mods without needing to manually install or manage them!
 * Why You Should Use Mod Loader:
   * Free & Open Source: No cost, no hidden fees, just an easy-to-use tool for everyone.
   * No Technical Skills Required: Anyone can use it, from beginners to experienced users.
   * Safe and Secure: Mods are sourced from trusted URLs and can be read by the standard user, with the format ```Bookmarklet name <> url.com```
   * Old versions do not get removed, but instead archived, while the modloader no longer can get updated mods, you can still inject the updated or legacy modloader as a mod itself.

Whether you're customizing a web app or enhancing your browser experience, the Mod Loader makes managing mods easier and more efficient than ever before.
You can even use it for fun.
